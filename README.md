There are 3 steps that we need to take in the TDD/BDD process:
1. Create Unit Test Case NAMES (I have already started this for you, and these tests will be empty and therefore will fail)
2. Define the Test Case code (these tests will still fail because there won't be any function code yet)
3. Write Functions/Classes to meet Test Case requirements (make the tests pass)

To start, I would like everyone to individually try to set up the python venv and get to the point where you can run the command: pytest -svv

Without making changes to the code, you should see 17 failed tests, 5 passed tests

Next Steps:
a. Look at the SimpleCalculator Class and Tests to see how TDD/BDD should be implemented.
  i. test_bar_is_green() is also an example I created for your reference.
b. You can then try steps 2 and 3 (above) for the remainder of the ClassifyBar Unit Tests.  We will review this together at the next team meeting.

You may not understand the terminology fully, and that is OK.  We first want to understand how simple/challenging it is to follow steps 1-3 above.  
I believe it will be good experience for each of you to attempt to define this, as this is essentially System Architecture Design.
